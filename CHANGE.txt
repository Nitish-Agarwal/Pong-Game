This file contains all the deviations we have made from our initial design.




Firstly, we have made a new table, 'votes_store'. This table stores all the votes by all the users for all the complaints.

This table consists of three fields - 
- Complaint ID
- Table Name
- User name.



This table can be checked to know whether a user has already voted for the particular complaint or not.


New APIs that we have used are -

- /project/insert.php
2 --> To keep the track of users voting on the complaints and to ensure that same user does not vote twice on same problem.

-/project/check_votes.php


 --> Before upvoting/downvoting it will check if that user has voted for that complaint before.
